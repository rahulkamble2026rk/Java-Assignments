Q1.Write programs for following questions.

1.WAP to understand working of regular inner classes.

2.WAP to understand working of method local inner classes. Perform some experiment.

3.WAP to understand working of anonymous inner classes created from concrete classes.
Perform some experiment.

4.WAP to understand working of anonymous inner classes created from interfaces.
Perform experiments.

5.WAP to understand working of abstract keyword.

6.WAP to understand working of protected keyword.

7.WAP to understand working of garbage collector.
Try to run garbage collector explicitly using both possible ways.

8.WAP to understand working of finalize() method. Check the behaviour of JVM 
when some object becomes available for garbage collection more than once.

9.WAP to understand working of import.
-check explicit import and implicit import.
-Create package pkg1 containing package pkg2 containing class Myclass.
Try to access MyClass in your package.
-try to import class from different packages. Try to generate ambiguity error.
Then solve that ambiguity error.

10.WAP to understand working of static control flow and instance control flow.
Perform some experiments. Check RIWO and R&W states.

11.
class Student
{
	name, age, marks
}
Create an array of 6 students. Sort this array in ascending order by age.

12.Create an SLL. Implement following functions.
-show()
-addatbeg()
-addatend()
-delatbeg()
-delatend()

13.Create class Calculator. This class calculates arithmetic results of 2 integers,
it can find out area and perimeter of rectangle, area and circumference of circle,
it can find power of given number, lcm and gcd of 2 numbers.
Implement all above functions using package concept. Group similar operations in 
one package and call them from class Calculator.
