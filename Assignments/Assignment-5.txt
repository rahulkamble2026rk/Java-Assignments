=====
Q1.Write programs for following questions.

1.Write a menu driven program for arithmetic operation of 2 integers.

2.Write a menu driven program for arithmetic operation of 2 integers using value generating switch.

3.Scan 3 character monthname from user.(JAN,FEB,MAR,APR etc).
According to month,print the name of season.
FEB to MAY - SUMMER
JUN to SEP - MONSOON
OCT to JAN - WINTER
Write this program using switch case.

4.Scan and print an array of 6 integers in main() only.

5.Scan array of 6 characters in main().Count only uppercase alphabets in array.

6.Write a menu driven program to find area and perimeter(or circumference) of shape chosen by user.
For each shape ask user to choose area and perimeter or circumference.(nested switch and use of functions expected).

7.Write a recursive program to find n!.

8.Write a recursive program to find addition of digits in given number.

9.Scan array of 8 integers from user.Find largest and smallest value from array.
Use of functions expected.

10.Declare and initialize an array of 8 integers.Scan x from user.
Search x in array.If found,delete x.All occurrences of x should be deleted.

11.Write a program to find n th prime number.Write 3 different codes for 3 differenct logics.
i<num ; i<=num/2 ; i<=Math.sqrt(num)(import java.util.Math)
Test your program for following values of n.
n = 10000
n = 25000
n = 50000
n = 75000
n = 100000
Note the time of execution.

12.WAP to scan and print 1-D array of 6 integers using for each loop only.

13.WAP to copy source array of 6 integers into target array using for each loop only.

14.WAP to check all the possibilities of creation and initialization of a 2-D array.
Perform experiments.

15.WAP to print addition of 2 integers,addition of 3 integers,addition 2 fractions and addition 3 short values.

SET-2
(In every program use of functions is expected)

1.Create a 2-D array of 3X5.Scan its values from user.Print addition of only even elements in aray.

2.Create a 2-D array of 3X5.Print row wise addition of elements in array.

3.Create two 1-D arrays of n elements.Scan data for each aray from user.Store indexwise addition of squares
of elements of both arrays in third array.Print third array.Example given below.
input = 
first array  =  2   4   7   3   2
Second array =  3   4   2   2   3 
==================================
Result Array = 13  32  53  13  13

4.Scan a 2-D array of mXn.Scan x from user.Check if x is present in the array or not.

5.Create a 2-D array of 3X5.Scan and print this array using for each loop.

6.Create a jagged aray of 4 rows containing 3,5,2,3 columns in each row respectively.
Scan and print elements of array.

7.Scan a number from user in integer variable.Now store this number in an array in such a way that
each element of array contains one digit of number.
Do this for 2 integers.Now perform addition of given 2 numbers using 2 arrays you have used 
to store digits.Print the addition.

8.Scan 10 integers from user.Store them in an array num in such a way that everytime you add element
in array,array remains sorted in ascending order.

9.Scan a number from user.Find its binary hexadecimal and octal value.
Store these values in array and print those values.

10.Scan a binary of 16 bits from user and store it an array.
Convert this binary into decimal.
If done with this,think about negative values.
It means think if given binary is of positive number or negative number.

11.Scan 2 matrices from user of mXn.(m is number of rows.n is number of columns,both are input from user)
Perform their addition in third matrix.
Print third matrix.

12.Scan a matrix of mXn.Print its columnwise addition.
example = 
 3  6  4
 2  6  9
 5  3  3
===========
10 15 16

13.Scan an array of n integers.Your task is to find peak vaue in given array.
Peak value is the value which is greater than or equal to its adjacent values.
There can be multiple peak values in an array.Your task is to find any one of them.
example
int num[] = {12,5,8,16,4};
Here peak values are 12 and 16.

14.Scan a 2-D array of mXn.Find minimum and maximum values from array.

15.WAP to sort the given array of n fraction values.

16.WAP to reverse the given array of n integers.
